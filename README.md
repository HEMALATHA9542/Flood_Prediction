Machine Learning based flood prediction system using Python and Flask.
 
 
 🌊 Rising Waters: A Machine Learning Approach to Flood Prediction
📌 Project Overview

Rising Waters is a Machine Learning–based Flood Prediction System developed using Python and Flask.
The system predicts the likelihood of flood occurrence based on historical rainfall and weather-related data.
A trained ML model is integrated into a Flask web application to provide a simple and real-time prediction interface for users.

🚀 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/HEMALATHA9542/Flood_Prediction.git

2️⃣ Install Required Libraries
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn

3️⃣ Run the Flask Application
python app.py

4️⃣ Open in Browser

This is a local Flask application and runs on:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
📊 Output

The application predicts whether a flood is likely to occur or not based on the input data and displays the result through the web interface.

🔮 Future Scope

Improve prediction accuracy using larger and diverse flood-related datasets

Integrate real-time weather and river-level data APIs

Deploy the application on cloud platforms

Enable region-wise and seasonal flood risk analysis

Enhance UI with interactive charts and visualizations

Explore advanced ML and deep learning models

👥 Team Contribution

Developed as a collaborative team project

Data collection, preprocessing, and model training were done jointly

Flask application development was shared among team members

Testing, debugging, and validation performed collectively

Documentation and GitHub updates handled as a team

ℹ️ Note

Model files (.pkl) are not previewable on GitHub due to size limitations.
